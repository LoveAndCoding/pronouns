# Pronouns.LGBT

[pronouns.lgbt](https://pronouns.lgbt).

This site serves as a guide to pronouns covering the following topics:

-   What are personal pronouns
-   Some do's and don'ts for using people's pronouns
-   How you (yes, you!) can get better at using people's personal pronouns
-   Some digital stickers you can use to show off what your pronouns are

The primary purpose of this site is to be used as a resource for folks who may
not be familiar with personal pronouns. It is meant to serve as a tour guide
through the world of proper pronoun usage to help educate those folks who are
new to these things, as we all once were.
